# Migrating from Sequelize to Prisma

This repo contains a sample Express server with two main branches:

- [`main`](https://github.com/prisma/migrate-from-sequelize-to-prisma): Initial version of the Express server built with Sequelize
- [`prisma`](https://github.com/prisma/migrate-from-sequelize-to-prisma/tree/prisma): Final version of the Express server after it was migrated to Prisma

The [guide]() that walks through the migration process can be found in the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs). You can also [check out the open PR](https://github.com/prisma/migrate-from-sequelize-to-prisma/pull/1/files) for a quick overview of the main differences between Sequelize and Prisma.
